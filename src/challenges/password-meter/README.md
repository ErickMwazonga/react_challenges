# Password Strength Meter Reach Challenge

## Challenge Overview

The Password Strength Meter Reach Challenge is a coding challenge designed to test your ability to create a robust and accurate password strength meter. The goal is to create a password strength meter that can accurately evaluate the strength of a password and provide feedback to the user on how to improve it.

## Challenge Details

Your task is to build a password strength meter that meets the following requirements:

-   The password strength meter should take in a user's input as a password and provide a strength score.
-   The strength score should be based on a range of factors, including length, complexity, and uniqueness.
-   The strength score should be displayed to the user in a clear and concise manner, such as a numerical value or a visual indicator (e.g. a progress bar).
-   The strength score should be accompanied by feedback on how to improve the password's strength, such as suggestions for adding special characters or increasing the length.

## Challenge Requirements

To complete this challenge, you will need to demonstrate proficiency in the following areas:

-   Web development: You will need to create a web-based password strength meter that can be accessed through a browser.
-   Front-end development: You will need to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the password strength meter.
-   JavaScript: You will need to use JavaScript to evaluate the strength of a password and provide feedback to the user.
-   Security: You will need to ensure that the password strength meter is secure and cannot be exploited by hackers or other malicious actors.
